# Sparkfun Amp Enclosure (STA540)

Enclosure for the small stereo amp kit sold by Sparkfun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9612). This enclosure also includes space and cutouts for an external power switch, RCA audio-in jacks, a power jack and a 4 spring speaker terminal.

## Instructions

Case lid screws to base using 4 M3 x 12 mm socket head screws. The board screws into the bottom of the case using the provided screws in the amplifier kit. The RCA and power jacks are mounted upside down to the inbuilt shelf to provide easier access to the pins since the platform is not removable. I recommend gluing those jacks in with hot glue or just a dab of epoxy. Below is a list of links for all the components used in this build:
